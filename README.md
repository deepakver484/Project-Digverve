# Portuguese Bank Term Deposit Readme File
## Introduction
This project aims to help a Portuguese bank identify existing clients who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. The bank is experiencing a revenue decline due to clients not depositing as frequently as before. The bank wants to identify clients who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit, so they can focus their marketing efforts on such clients.

## Methodology
To achieve this goal, the project will use data analytics techniques. we will collect and analyze customer data, develop a predictive model, test the model, deploy the model, and monitor and adjust it.

## Analyze customer data: 
By analyzing this data, We can identify trends and patterns in customer behavior and preferences.

## Develop a predictive model: 
Using the customer data, We will develop a predictive model to identify customers who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. The model can use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify patterns that are predictive of future behavior.

##Test the model: 
We will test the model using a subset of customer data and measure its accuracy in predicting which customers are likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

## Monitor and adjust: 
We will continually monitor the performance of the predictive model and adjust it as needed to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness in identifying customers who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

## Building a Web App using Flask:
This project utilizes the Flask framework to build a web application that can predict whether a banking client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The web app includes 13 inputs form for collecting relevant client data, and it uses a machine learning model to make predictions. Flask provides a simple and flexible way to handle web requests and integrate them with the machine learning model.

## Deploying and Hosting on PythonAnywhere:
The web application is deployed and hosted on PythonAnywhere, which is a platform-as-a-service provider that allows users to run and manage their Python applications in the cloud. The web app can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection

## Conclusion
We created a model which can help Portuguese Bank to predict whihch clients are more likely to Subscribe to a term deposite
